            Before a guest even sees your kitchen, living room, foyer, or home theatre, the first thing they notice is the fence in your front yard. There are a lot of fence designs available. Although installation can be a little complicated. Not planning ahead things can lead to delays and complications. The first thing to decide on is which fence styles will work best for your yard. Take the time to learn about fences. Understand their functionality, material used, purpose, and height. A good understanding of these attributes is essential before calling a fencing contractor. Without proper research, you may not get a fence that fits your requirements.
            <br /> One of the first things to know is where to place your new fence? Are you enclosing your yard to define a property line or just to add aesthetic value? Is it for the front yard or the backyard. A front yard fence needs to give your home curb appeal and compliment its surroundings. This is more so than if the fence was for the backyard. It could be a fence for keeping pets and/or children in and protecting them against street traffic. Knowing the primary goal of your fence helps to determine what type of fence will be the most appropriate.
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/shutterstock_208308301.jpg" alt="decorative fence designs in nice neighborhood"> When it comes to backyard fencing, there are many reasons to have them. Some of those reasons are the same as having a front yard fencing. Fencing can always enhance the aesthetic appeal of a space. However, they also serve other functions. Backyard fences, for example, can help keep your landscape enclosed and under control. It also separates your backyard from the neighbors, keeping things neatly separated. It also serves many of the same functions as the front yard, such as keeping children and pets safe and protected. Fences make very nice boundaries that not only keep things in but also keep things out. It can be a burglar deterrent, however small, and also help to keep a lot of wild critters away from your house. Some fences have barbed wire on them to discourage people and animals from coming into your yard. Some fences come equipped with electric hooked to them to deliver a shock to anything that touches it. These types of fences are really good for security. A lot of homeowners love to have friends over and eat out back on a picnic table or porch setting. Having a fence keeps people from just walking up on you while you’re entertaining. It gives you much needed privacy as well as a sense of security.
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/shutterstock_208311529.jpg" alt="short wood and brick fence"> Once you’ve nailed down the reason and purpose of your fence, your next decision is decide on its height. For a fence that just adds to the aesthetic appeal of your home, you probably only need a fence that is a couple of feet high. However, if you want privacy then you may want to add a fence that is from 5 to 7 feet high. Before you decide on the height of your fence, check out your city codes and your home owner’s association (HOA) to see what is permitted. Some cities set the fence height cap at about 6 feet, but your HOA may have differing requirements. In fact, your HOA may require that fences in the community be of a certain color and material. So get this settled before your contractor buys any tools, fence panels, or any other materials. A fence that is mainly for cosmetic purposes does not need to be made from anything that is particularly strong. However, if privacy and security are the main objectives, then you want something sturdy that will last for years to come. Below are some of the most common materials used and their benefits:
            <p>Fencing Type by Material</p>
            <p class="lead">Wood</p>
            <br/> You can stain or paint wood to match the surrounding style. A wood fence can last as long as 15 to 20 years. Wood fences may serve as either a privacy fence or a decorative one. Why not both? There are many kinds of wood that fences can be made from including spruce, pine, redwood, and cedar. Some are even made from composite wood (recycled materials) and will have to be stained with a finish to withstand the elements. Wood fences require regular maintenance and occasional touch up to increase their longevity. When it comes to security, a wood fence is not the best choice because they can be easily broken to gain entrance into your yard.
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/45-shutterstock_39199438.jpg" alt="classy townhome garden with horizontal wood privacy fence"> This small backyard is closed in with a horizontal wooden fence. With the patio, there’s enough room for a nice barbecue.
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/46-shutterstock_81513076.jpg" alt="black wooden picket fence with white tops"> Here’s a nice low fence that is painted black and white tips on the the top.
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/47-shutterstock_58372177.jpg" alt="seaside home with wooden white fencing"> This is an example of a sea side home with white picket fence.
            <p class='lead'>Vinyl</p>
            This option is for those who want both good aesthetics and durability. Vinyl lasts a long time and can be installed as a picket fence or a board fence. The colors are somewhat limited for homeowners as it is only available in neutral shades. This material cannot be stained or painted like wood. Vinyl is moisture resistant but can develop mildew if exposed to damp conditions for an extended period of time. That means any sprinklers in the yard should be kept far enough away to keep from hitting the vinyl fence.
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/62-vinyl-fence-shutterstock_377777791.jpg" alt="vinyl fence along sidewalk">
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/63-vinyl-fence-shutterstock_146562410.jpg" alt="backyard vinyl fence with red umbrella">
            <p class="lead">Metal</p>
            A lot of fences are made with metal. It is strong, versatile, and comes in many styles. It can be used for decoration, privacy, and security. Below are the most common types of metal used for fencing.
            <p class="lead">Aluminum</p>
            As far as metal fencing options go, there are plenty of them. The kind you choose to install will depend on how much security and privacy you need. Fences made of aluminum are very strong, long-lasting, and make for excellent security. They are very efficient at keeping kids and pets in and out of unwanted areas. They can come in 2-rail and 3-rail types that are extremely durable. There is very little maintenance involved. All they need is a good washing from time to time.
            <p class="lead">Steel</p>
            A steel fence is an even stronger fence than one made of aluminum and is excellent in terms of security. The rails of a steel fence can withstand 4 times as much impact as aluminum ones. They also hold up better against erosion caused by the climate. They require practically no maintenance.
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/13-shutterstock_364731416.jpg" alt="Vintage charcoal grey steel gates and fence"> A cool fence and gate form the opening to an impressive building. The fence is created from steel with very detailed designs of circles, triangles, and other shapes.
            <p class="lead">Wrought Iron</p>
            This type of fence is also excellent for security reasons. It is durable and can last you as long as 50 years or more when cared for properly. To get the best security from this type of fence it is recommended that you get one that is no less than 6 feet tall. The ones that are 4 feet tall are considered to be medium security.

The fence and gate is a simple metal design. The columns and foundation is custom stone. Tall trees are planted behind the fence to increase privacy.
            <p class="lead">Brick</p>
            A brick fence is among the most expensive choice for a fence. However, it is also among the most secure privacy options available for a yard. Brick actually requires no maintenance and gives you some of the best security in accordance with its height. It is also a great barrier to sound which makes it better for holding barbecues and pool parties in your backyard. However, in order to have a brick wall around the yard a strong foundation is required. If the ground beneath it happens to erode, then the entire fence can come tumbling down. Below are a couple of ideas for fences.
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/56-shutterstock_187626680.jpg" alt="bungalow with red brick fence">
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/57-shutterstock_244276747.jpg" alt="house with stone brick fencing and roof tile">
            <p class="lead">Glass</p>
            Glass fencing is usually used around pools as an enclosure. It has no security or privacy value since this material is clear and easy to climb over. Using glass for fencing adds a modern sleek style to your home decor. Glass requires a lot of cleaning maintenance since it gets dusty and dirty easily. On its own, glass can last a long time. However, it is not very durable if it gets struck by a blunt object.
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/59-shutterstock_154859867.jpg" alt="tall modern glass fence"> The border-less glass fence creates the appearance of a more open space. Visitors are able to see the neatly groomed grass from the sidewalk.

            <p class="lead">Bamboo</p>
            Bamboo is actually a type of grass. These fences are mainly used decoratively. It is a sustainable material source since bamboo grows quite fast. Bamboo adds a one of a kind Asian style element to garden. A couple of other advantage of bamboo is its durability, sturdiness, and low level of maintenance.

            <br/> The last consideration when deciding on a fence is picking the right look. Again, it is necessary to set your priorities. What’s the most important? Is it security, privacy, or looks?
            <p>Fence Types by Purpose</p>
            <p class="lead">Privacy and Security</p>
            Privacy fences are usually tall, spanning six feet or more and do not have holes are gaps in them. Its purpose is to prevent people outside from seeing the fenced surroundings. Meanwhile, security fences serve as a barrier to entry for intruders. Again, these are taller fences that are more difficult to scale. Most of the time, a privacy fence combines security as well. They can be made from a variety materials. Common ones include metal, wood, brick, and vinyl.
            <br/> Here are two examples of fences that ensure privacy and security.
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/48-shutterstock_108334340.jpg" alt="New construction private security wooden fence"> With this fence, there is no worries about people peeking into your gorgeous island kitchen.

            <p>Decorative</p>
            Decorative fences are used for fence design and decor. They are usually short and complements the style of the surrounding area. It is popular to use them around gardens, front yard, and outdoors.
            <img class="d-block" src="./img/article4/30-shutterstock_58719706.jpg" alt="gray home with white trim, french style entrance, and deco style fence"> Decorative fence ideas come in many forms.

            <p>Fencing Styles</p>
            <p class="lead">Lattice</p>
            Lattice fences have diagonal designs with about 2 inches of spacing between panels made of wood, PVC, or vinyl. These can give you a small bit of privacy but there are still small holes that allow for light and probing eyes up close. Many people use this kind of fencing around their gardens and for growing ivy walls. There is also a variation of this type of fence where only the top is lattice. This way, it can serve as a privacy and decorative fence.

            <p class="lead">Chain Link</p>
            The chain link design is made from coated steel wires or galvanized steel wires that form a zigzag diamond pattern. These fences work good at keeping pets and children in but not so good at security or privacy unless a fence screen is added to block the holes. Privacy fence screens can also be used to block wind and dust.

            <p>Picket</p>
            Picket fences are traditional decorative fences that are very commonly placed in the front yard. They are usually around three feet high, attractive, and have evenly spaced boards that sit vertically. They can be made from vinyl, sheet metal, or wood. They are attached to rails. These fences are mainly for aesthetics. Don’t count on them for any kind of security or privacy. Below are several kinds of picket fences.
            <p>White</p>
